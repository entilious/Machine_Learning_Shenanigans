        17. CANCELLATION_CODE - Reason for Cancellation of flight: A - Airline/Carrier; B - Weather; C - National Air System; D - Security
        18. DIVERTED - Aircraft landed on airport that out of schedule
        19. CRS_ELAPSED_TIME - Planned time amount needed for the flight trip
        20. ACTUAL_ELAPSED_TIME - AIR_TIME+TAXI_IN+TAXI_OUT

        22. DISTANCE - Distance between two airports
        23. CARRIER_DELAY - Delay caused by the airline in minutes
        24. WEATHER_DELAY - Delay caused by weather
        25. NAS_DELAY - Delay caused by air system
        26. SECURITY_DELAY - Delay caused by security
        27. LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY
        28 Unnamed - useless column

    2. Data Pre-Processing
        The entire dataset is not exactly useful in training the model as it contains NaN values at given instances and the presence
        of unnecessary columns or columns containing redundant data, i.e. 'FL_DATE' and 'OP_CARRIER', are to be removed in the pre-processing.

        The columns removed from the initial dataset are -

        1. FL_DATE
        2. OP_CARRIER
        3. OP_CARRIER_FL_NUM
        4. CANCELLATION_CODE
        5. Unnamed: 27

        The removed columns have no use in training the model whatsoever, so evicted they are.

        According to the FAA, the columns 'CARRIER_DELAY', 'WEATHER_DELAY', 'NAS_DELAY', 'SECURITY_DELAY', 'LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY' play a significant role in causing delay.

        Thus the columns are also considered for training the model. Given, how these columns contain instances of NULL values. The rows containing NULL values for these columns are removed

        Apart from that the model also takes into account the possibility that the airports themselves may be the cause of delay because of the way they operate. Certain airports and routes
        are known to be "delayed" and thus they too are to be taken into account when training the model. However, given how the geographical location of the origin and destination airports
        in the dataset is confined to the US of A, the columns 'ORIGIN' and 'DEST' have been exempted from being a part of the training dataset. Nonetheless, it would be wise to include them if
        dataset is not confined to a single geographical location.

        After making the aforementioned changes to the original dataset (finalmente.csv), the obtained dataset is then used to create the class-wise instances. 0 represents on-time flights, 1 represents delayed flights.
        Given how a flight is declared "Delayed" if it is 15 minutes late in departing or arriving, the same principle will be used to declare the class instance for each row.

       2. Proposed Models
            1. XGBoost Classifier
            2. Decision Tree Classifier
            3. Random Forest Classifier
            4. Hist-Gradient Boost Classifier
            5. Logistic Regression Classifier

       3. Pre-split cleaning

            The 'final_dataset.csv' is further cleaned to remove the columns containing information regarding arrival as the
            information in these columns will not be available when making real-time predictions.
            [I know this could've been done in pre-processing, but me lazy and forgetful so here we are.]

            After which, the dataset is now to be balanced as the number of instances in 'Delayed' column for 0 and 1 are heavily imbalanced.

            0 - 1045706
            1 - 2869

            Using 'RandomUnderSampler' from 'imblearn' package, the dataset is now balanced and saved as 'finale_undersampled_ds.csv'.
            The instances of 0 and 1 in the 'Delayed' column are balanced.

            0 - 20839
            1 - 20839

3. Model Testing

    The data in 'finale_undersampled_ds.csv' is split using the 80:20 rule for training and testing.
    The feature columns are assigned to the variable 'x' while the class column is assigned to 'y'.
    The aforementioned models were tested using the same dataset after splitting. Accuracy and Confusion matrix for the models
    can be found in 'Model-wise accuracies.docx' and 'Model Confusion Matrices' [folder] respectively.

    P.S. I recommend using Logistic Regression Classifier as your model as it shows some error which is more believable than having a 100% accurate model.
         Nonetheless, you can show that you tested so and so models.
